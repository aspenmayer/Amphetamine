# Hello 👋🏼

On Apple Silcon Mac laptops, Closed-Display Mode may not work as expected after connecting or disconnecting your Mac from an external power source such as a power adapter or display with power delivery. To avoid any issues, you can install a script and configuration file that addresses the issue. 

I'm truely sorry for this, but Apple provides no other way. Apple thinks it knows better than you do, and won't allow Amphetamine to directly install the script and configuration file needed to avoid issues with Closed-Display Mode. To get things to "just work" nowadays, you have to do it yourself it seems. 🔨💪🏼
